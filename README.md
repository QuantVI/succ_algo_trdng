###### succ_algo_trdng (Sucessful Algorithmic Trading - Build)
##### _Successful Angorithmic Trading_ is a book my M.H.Moore, that gives insight into, investigation about, and implementation of, a statistical machine learning for trading.

This repository contains code replciateing and modifying that presented in the book. The modifiations to the code are less important than modifications of the trading strategies implemented - but in type and number.

The Aims (clear-cut, feasible, and/or astronomical) of this project are the following:
1. Take action beyond reading the book
2. Next-level coding  
   a. Practice Python 3.X
      - the book tuilized Python 2.X code. Though it tried to be forward-looking
      - I'm well-versed in basic Python "scripting" . This project allows be to build a _live_ srcipt :arrow_right: an "app"
      - additionally, work with or continue to work with some popular libraries (e.g. pandas by Wes McKinney)  
   b. A purely coded Python app, is programming, maybe even software engineering
      - Programming moves a mathematical & technical user beyong the world of drag-n-drop, and menus (No Excel!)
      - This interpreted language has high human-readability, and up-to-date speed, and application (No Excel/VBA!)
3. Bring to life the elements of my Financial Engineering masters program
   - Econometrics: is alive and well in this book. It's time to use time-series
   - Derivatives: are more comlpex investment vehicls. Can we used a derivative-based strategy?
   - Portfolio Theory, et cetera.
   - Practical use of master's level mathematics, moves the user beyond the world of dashboards and anaytics
4. Approximate a Quantitative Analyst (in the Finance/Investment career space)  
   - A Quantitative Analyst can be defined using the analog of a Visual Artist
     - A Visual Artist (e.g. painter, sculptor) is considered professional, when they bring 3 skills to a high level
       - depiction of a subject
       - proper use of a medium
       - objective artistic ability (presentig thhe subject via the medium in specific/prolicif/elucidating ways
     Quantitative ana
