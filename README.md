###### succ_algo_trdng (Sucessful Algorithmic Trading - Build)
##### _Successful Angorithmic Trading_ is a book my M.H.Moore, that gives insight into, investigation about, and implementation of, a statistical machine learning for trading.

This repository contains code replciateing and modifying that presented in the book. The modifiations to the code are less important than modifications of the trading strategies implemented - but in type and number.

The Aims (clear-cut, feasible, and/or astronomical) of this project are the following:
1. Take action beyond reading the book
2. Next-level coding  
   a. Practice Python 3.X
   - the book tuilized Python 2.X code. Though it tried to be forward-looking
   - I'm well-versed in basic Python "script" writing. This project allows be to build a _live_ srcipt :arrow_right: an "app"
   - additionally, work with or continue to work with some popular libraries (e.g. pandas by Wes McKinney)
   - A purely coded Python app, is programming, maybe even software engineering
3. Bring to life the elements of my Financial Engineering masters program
   - Econometrics: is alive and well in this book. It's time to use time-series
   - Derivatives: are more comlpex investment vehicls. Can we used a derivative-based strategy?
   - Et cetera
