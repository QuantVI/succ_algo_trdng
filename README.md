###### succ_algo_trdng (Sucessful Algorithmic Trading - Build)
##### _Successful Angorithmic Trading_ is a book my M.H.Moore, that gives insight into, investigation about, and implementation of statistical machine learning for trading.

This repository contains code replciateing and modifying that presented in the book. The modifiations to the code are less important than modifications of the trading strategies implemented - but in type and number.

The Aims (clear-cut, feasible, and/or astronomical) of this project are the following:
1. Take action beyond reading the book
2. Coding skill improvement  
   a. Practice Python 3.X
      - the book tuilized Python 2.X code. Though it tried to be forward-looking
      - I'm well-versed in basic Python "scripting" . This project allows be to build a _live_ srcipt :arrow_right: an "app"
      - additionally, work with or continue to work with some popular libraries (e.g. pandas by Wes McKinney)  
   b. A purely coded Python app, is programming, maybe even software engineering  
      - Programming moves a mathematical & technical user beyong the world of drag-n-drop, and menus (No Excel!)
      - This interpreted language has high human-readability, and up-to-date speed, and application (No Excel/VBA!)
3. Bring to life the elements of my Financial Engineering masters program
   - Econometrics: is alive and well in this book. It's time to use time-series
   - Derivatives: are more comlpex investment vehicls. Can we used a derivative-based strategy?
   - Portfolio Theory, et cetera.
   - Practical use of master's level mathematics, moves the user beyond the world of dashboards and anaytics
4. Approximate activites of a Quantitative Analyst (e.g. alpha-strategy testing and implementation)  
   - A Quantitative Analyst can be defined using the analog of a Visual Artist
     - A __Visual Artist__ (e.g. painter, sculptor) is considered professional, when they bring 3 skills to a high level
       - depiction of a subject
       - proper use of a medium
       - objective Artistic ability
         - presenting the subject via the medium in specific, prolific, elucidating ways
         - this Artistic ability is objectively higher than the average untrained person, or those with less training
           - e.g. A child with water colors, most who draw with pen(s) and paper
     - A __Quantitative Analyst__ is considered professional, when they bring 3 skills to a high level
       - depiction of the subject(s) of Investments/Assets/Finance
       - proper use of a medium known as the programming language (Pyton > R > SAS > VBA > Tableau)
       - objective Mathematical ability
         - presenting the Financial subject utilizeing programming with the high-level Mathematical precision
         - this Mathematical ability is objectively higher than the average untrained person, or thos with less training
           - e.g. A typical Data(base)/Financial/Business Intelligence - Analyst, Data Scientist
5. Augment the syetm with a different Machine Learning system than used in the book
   - Can the hreat of ous engine use an Neural Network instead?
6. (Astronomical) Auto Strategies
   - if there was a way to bottle the concept of a signal, automatical create them, and automaticall compare their timing with that of market movements, you'd have an auto-alpha-generating system.
