# Where I left-off
### Edit this file after each session, to make it easier to resume working next time.


#### Possible things to include

- what did you last do
- what did you test?
- where did you test it?
- what worked or didn't?
- what to do next time?

##### recap
it seems the last things I idd was make a prototype file for price retrival.py

in the book, `requests` is used, but we can use `pandas.datareader` which also has a way, though obscrued, to read from Yahoo! Finance without supplying the direct url for manipulation.

Book Page 56 (65/208) "Price Retrieval"

we will continue working with the _price retrieval_ file.

##### intermediate
considering having an entire test directory.

##### conclusion
